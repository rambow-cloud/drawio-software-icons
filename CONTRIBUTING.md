## Requests and pull requests / 提交需求与 PR

Use the homepage's **Request an icon / feature** link or the [request forms](https://github.com/rambow-cloud/drawio-software-icons/issues/new/choose) to suggest icons, correct artwork or report problems. No code changes are required. Include product names, the official homepage, the collection, your use case, and any known artwork sources or brand terms. English and Chinese are both welcome.

Already have changes? Use **Submit a PR** on the homepage or [compare your branch or fork](https://github.com/rambow-cloud/drawio-software-icons/compare). The PR template collects the change summary, related issue, icon provenance, validation results and compatibility impact. Both website entrypoints send contributions to this repository.

仅提需求可点击首页的**提交图标 / 功能需求**，填写图标申请或功能反馈表单，无需修改代码。请提供产品名称、官网、图标集、使用场景，以及已知的素材来源或品牌规范，中英文均可。

已有修改则点击首页的**提交 PR**，选择你的分支或 Fork，按自动填入的模板说明变更、关联需求、图标来源、验证结果和兼容性影响。主站与阿里云入口统一在本仓库处理。

## Add or correct an icon / 添加或修正图标

1. Edit or add `data/icons/*.json`: choose a stable lowercase ID, a name, one category, a source and the project homepage. See [configuration examples](docs/ICON_CONFIGURATION.md). Devicon entries use their upstream ID; Dashboard Icons entries use the SVG filename without `.svg`.
2. Add bilingual aliases and relevant tags. Mark ambiguous software classifications as `unverified`; never classify software from the artwork collection's license.
3. Configure new source rules in `data/icon-sources.json` when needed. If artwork only exists in a newer upstream commit, set the source's `revision`, or run `npm run sync -- --update` and review generated source pins.
4. Run `npm run build:cloudflare` and `npm test`; both synchronize configuration automatically. Open the local preview and inspect artwork, proportions and downloads. Follow the README browser checks for draw.io.
5. A configuration-only PR is sufficient: publishing builds generate missing assets, catalogs and pins. You may include generated snapshots for review or offline builds. Explain source changes and provide references.

编辑 JSON 配置时给每个软件选择一个主分类，跨用途使用搜索标签，不重复收录。填写真实项目地址，许可不清晰则标记待核实。可以只提交配置，流水线自动下载、校验和生成产物；本地构建后仍需检查预览效果。

## Localization / 中英文

Icon update history lives in `data/changelog.json`, newest batch first, with dates in Asia/Shanghai. `npm run sync` automatically appends added, updated and removed software icon groups (and license-only changes); review its generated English and Chinese title/summary before merging. Manual artwork changes and collection imports must add an entry too. Keep historical names and removed IDs, and record separate batches rather than overwriting past entries. Validation requires every current software icon to have an addition record. Builds generate both Markdown changelogs, the website timeline and offline ZIP copies from this single source.

图标日志维护在 `data/changelog.json`，最新批次在前，日期采用 Asia/Shanghai。采集脚本自动记录新增、更新、移除及许可变更，合并前可补充具体的中英文说明；手动替换素材或合并图标集也须添加记录。保留历史名称及已移除 ID，不覆盖旧批次。构建会从同一份数据生成网站时间线、中英文 Markdown 和离线包中的日志。

Observability additions live in `data/icons/observability.json`, including bilingual aliases and telemetry-specific tags. Keep them in the existing Monitoring & Security category. Grafana publisher SVGs use the entry's `artwork` object with `format: "svg"` and are preserved unchanged. Dashboard Icons additions use their pinned revision. Software licensing is separate from artwork rights; do not classify hosted or enterprise editions from the community repository's license.

监控类新增项目维护于 `data/icons/observability.json`，补充中英文别名及日志、指标、追踪等搜索标签，沿用「监控与安全」分类。原始素材在条目的 `artwork` 中固定版本并原样保留；不要将社区版的软件许可套用到图标、托管服务或企业版。

AI additions belong in `data/icons/data.json` under the existing `data` (Analytics & AI) category. Choose the upstream color SVG when available, record its exact filename in `artwork.path` and add Chinese / English aliases. Classify the linked tool or hosted service separately from model-weight licenses. Lobe Icons artwork is community-collected; do not label it as an official publisher download or infer brand-use permission from its MIT license.

UI strings are paired in `src/i18n.ts`. Categories use `data/categories.json` and `data/categories.en.json`. Both locales must contain corresponding entries. Product names remain in their original language. Search uses both category languages regardless of the selected UI language. Keep the default English `README.md` and Chinese `README.zh-CN.md` in sync; `README.en.md` is a compatibility link.

Messaging and enterprise additions are maintained in `data/icons/applications.json`, with Chinese / English aliases and a reviewed software type. Configure upstream revisions and licenses in `data/icon-sources.json`; configure paths in the icon entry. Commercial entries retain generated `drawio-architecture-only` project-use metadata. Follow `ICON_USAGE.md`; never infer brand-owner permission from an icon collection license. Preserve upstream rights, attribution and source requirements, including verbatim GPL SVG source where applicable.

## Stable interfaces / 稳定接口

Keep icon IDs stable. Set each entry's `category` by project purpose, independently of its upstream collection. When merging categories, add retired IDs to `categoryAliases` in `data/taxonomy.mjs` and preserve published localized library paths in `data/legacy-categories.json`. The generator serves those paths with the successor category while the ZIP and website list only current categories. Renames without compatibility mappings are breaking changes. Additive metadata may keep `schemaVersion: 1`; incompatible schema changes require a version increase.

图标归类直接修改 JSON 配置的 `category`。分类合并时使用 `data/taxonomy.mjs` 保留旧 ID 映射和 XML 地址，避免已保存的链接失效；中英文分类与使用说明需同步更新。

SVGs must be safe and self-contained. Scripts, event handlers, external resources and invalid dimensions fail validation. Do not rasterize, recolor or redraw a logo merely to bypass a validation failure; investigate the source or exclude the entry.

Official publisher PNGs are also supported. Prefer original color publisher artwork over monochrome substitutes. Pin each PNG's URL, product listing, publisher, dimensions and SHA-256 in the entry's `artwork` configuration; the build generates `data/official-icons.json`. Never silently replace pinned artwork during monthly updates. Keep original pixels, distinguish Feishu from Lark, and describe PNG as raster artwork. Use `inspectPng` validation and embed PNG bytes directly in libraries. The dedicated rights notice must not claim an open-source artwork license.

For DingTalk, the manifest's `presentation` adds an SVG rounded-corner clip around the original PNG. Preserve both source and packaged hashes and include the original PNG in the ZIP. Do not replace this with website-only CSS: downloads and draw.io must use the same clipped asset.
